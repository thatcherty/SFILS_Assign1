# MISFILS
MISFILS: The MongoDB-based Implementation for the San Francisco Integrated Library System.

This folder contains the submission files for Assignment 2. The remaining folders contain the files from Assignment 1.

Make sure to keep all your Assignment 2 files inside this folder to keep the rest of the folders free from clutter. That way, it will be easier to grade both Assignment 1 and Assignment 2.
