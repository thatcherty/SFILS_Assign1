# What the app includes
 - The app allows you to view the contents of the DB
 - You can view individual records by selecting Details on the right side
 - You can apply various filters by using the selections below each column header
 - You can advance through pages of records to view the next records in the result of your search filters
 - I removed the options for editing or creating new records since this was expressed as unnecessary in class

Once the app loads, you should see something similar to the below:

If you select Details on a Patron record, you will see the below page:
